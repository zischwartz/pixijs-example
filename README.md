To run a simple server, open the terminal and `cd` to the directory you want to serve the files of (ie this directory).

Then run:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
# if that doesn't work try: python -m http.server
```

Now goto [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in your browser or [click here](http://localhost:8000)
